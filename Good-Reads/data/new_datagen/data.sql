Congress would finish up the week with a few votes on the House Floor and then members would rush to Reagan National Airport to catch a flight home.

VALUES (474, 'Prizing Children''''s Literature', 'Children''s book awards have mushroomed since the early twentieth-century and especially since the 1960s, when literary prizing became a favored strategy for both commercial promotion and canon-making. There are over 300 awards for English-language titles alone, but despite the profound impact of children’s book awards, scholars have paid relatively little attention to them. This book is the first scholarly volume devoted to the analysis of Anglophone children''s book awards in historical and cultural context. With attention to both political and aesthetic concerns, the book offers original and diverse scholarship on prizing practices and their consequences in Australia, Canada, and especially the United States. Contributors offer both case studies of particular awards and analysis of broader trends in literary evaluation and elevation, drawing on theoretical work on canonization and cultural capital. Sections interrogate the complex and often unconscious ideological work of prizing, the ongoing tension between formalist awards and so-called identity-based awards — all the more urgent in light of the "We Need Diverse Books" campaign — the ever-morphing forms and parameters of prizing, and scholarly practices of prizing. Among the many awards discussed are the Pura Belpré Medal, the Inky Awards, the Canada Governor General Literary Award, the Printz Award, the Best Animated Feature Oscar, the Phoenix Award, and the John Newbery Medal, giving due attention to prizes for fiction as well as for non-fiction, poetry, and film. This volume will interest scholars in literary and cultural studies, social history, book history, sociology, education, library and information science, and anyone concerned with children''s literature.', 'Book', '2016-11-10', 25, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PCMlDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

What do the best fashion companies do that set them apart? Why some companies make it to the top only to go bankrupt a few years later? Is fashion dying? Some seem to think so. Or is it merely a matter of mismanagement? Ralph Lauren closed his flagship Polo store. But Amancio Ortega’s fashion empire is still strong, making him one of the richest men in the entire world across all industries. In this book, we will examine what makes a great fashion company and brand. We look at five key dynamics from various perspectives: • Leadership • Problem solving • Vision • How we see our people • Building creativity and innovation There is no magic bullet that solves everything. There is no overnight success. But there are tested techniques that, when used consistently, build the momentum of an organization until it is unstoppable.

VALUES (476, 'Cultural Capitalism', 'Cultural Capitalism explores Russian literature''s eager embrace of capitalism in the post-Soviet era. When the Soviet Union fell, books were suddenly bought and sold as commodities. Russia''s first bestseller lists brought attention and prestige. Even literary prizes turned to the market for legitimacy. The rise of capitalism entirely transformed both the economics and the aesthetics of Russian literature. By reconstructing the market''s influence on everything from late-Soviet paper shortages to the prose of neoimperialism, Cultural Capitalism reveals Russian literature''s exuberant hopes for and deep disappointments in capitalism. Only a free market, it was hoped, could cure endemic book deficits and liberate literature from ideological constraints. But as the market came to dominate literature, it imposed an ideology of its own, one that directed literary development for decades. Through archival research, original interviews, and provocative readings of literary texts, Bradley A. Gorski immerses the reader in both the economic and aesthetic worlds of post-Soviet Russian literature to reveal a cultural logic dominated by capitalism. The Russian 1990s and early 2000s saw markets introduced, adopted, and debated at an accelerated pace, all against the backdrop of a socialist past, staging the polemics between capitalism and culture in high drama and sharp relief. But the market forces at the center of the post-Soviet transition are fundamental to cultural trends worldwide. By revealing the complexities of Russia''s story, Cultural Capitalism mounts a critique that cuts across national borders and provides a new way of seeing culture in the post-1989 era worldwide.', 'Book', '2025-03-15', 26, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d_wvEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

Often, it is the success in itself that generates an interest because popularity begets popularity. Quite often though, a hyped bestseller is met with a skeptic criticism of poor language, a badly constructed plot, a predictable story line, or all three. The bestseller phenomenon is sometimes conceived as a threat against “real” literature. Research into the creation, reception, and meaning of bestsellers is utterly scarce and Hype: Bestsellers and Literary Culture is an important contribution to the understanding of the literature read by the masses. Popular literature plays an important role in the lives of millions of readers, offering entertainment, social commentary, and alternate perspectives on everyday life. This volume brings together such diverse issues as the creation of hype, the role and the meaning of the author in the present-day media landscape, changes in the book trade, and the relationship between bestsellers and research into them.

They’re twins, and like many teenagers their age, they’re dealing with stress and anxiety. One day on their way to school, they have a nice conversation with their old family friend and youth soccer coach, Mr. Erwin, who shows them a special garden he created in his backyard. The garden serves as both a place and a metaphor for Mr. Erwin to share a powerful paradigm and practical strategies to help the twins overcome their fear, stress, and anxiety. The Garden is an enlightening and encouraging spiritual fable that reveals the 5 D’s that can sabotage us and a proven plan to help us overcome and win the battle in our mind. Rooted in Jon Gordon’s faith tradition, this fable is a different kind of book than his previous business fables. However, in his familiar trademark style, he takes a complex subject and simplifies it to help people take action and improve their lives. Everyone will struggle with fear, anxiety, or stress at some point in their lives, and everyone will have to overcome these challenges to create the life they were meant to live. Given that there are many contributing factors that influence how we think and feel, Jon wrote this book to share how the power of love, encouragement, truth, faith, and belief can be part of the solution. Having worked with countless leaders, companies, sports teams, professional athletes, and high school students, Jon Gordon infuses this life-changing story with thought-provoking ideas, practical strategies, and a framework to overcome fear with faith. Whether you are dealing with fear, stress, and anxiety yourself, have a family member that struggles, or are a mental health expert that works with clients, if any of the ideas in this book can be useful to you or the people you love and care about, then it’s worth a walk through The Garden with Jay, Kay, and Mr. Erwin to discover ways to persevere through life with the power of faith, hope, and love.', 'Book', '2020-05-21', 15, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oDXnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

The product of nearly two decades of qualitative research into readers and reading culture, What Readers Do examines reading through three dimensions - aesthetic conduct, moral conduct, and self-care  to show how readers intertwine private and social behaviors, and both reinforce and oppose the structures of capitalism. Analyzing reading as a post-digital practice that is a synthesis of both print and digital modes and on- and offline behaviors, Driscoll presents a methodology for studying readers that connects book history, literary studies, sociology, and actor-network theory.

Smith argues that this literature served as a form of extra-ecclesiastical ministry and credits the popularity and longevity of religious books to their day-to-day usefulness rather than their theological correctness or aesthetic quality. Drawing on publishers'' records, letters by readers to authors, promotional materials, and interviews with contemporary religious-reading groups, Smith offers a comprehensive study that finds surprising overlap across the religious spectrum--Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish, liberal and conservative.

VALUES (496, 'Prizing Children''''s Literature', 'Children''s book awards have mushroomed since the early twentieth-century and especially since the 1960s, when literary prizing became a favored strategy for both commercial promotion and canon-making. There are over 300 awards for English-language titles alone, but despite the profound impact of children’s book awards, scholars have paid relatively little attention to them. This book is the first scholarly volume devoted to the analysis of Anglophone children''s book awards in historical and cultural context. With attention to both political and aesthetic concerns, the book offers original and diverse scholarship on prizing practices and their consequences in Australia, Canada, and especially the United States. Contributors offer both case studies of particular awards and analysis of broader trends in literary evaluation and elevation, drawing on theoretical work on canonization and cultural capital. Sections interrogate the complex and often unconscious ideological work of prizing, the ongoing tension between formalist awards and so-called identity-based awards — all the more urgent in light of the "We Need Diverse Books" campaign — the ever-morphing forms and parameters of prizing, and scholarly practices of prizing. Among the many awards discussed are the Pura Belpré Medal, the Inky Awards, the Canada Governor General Literary Award, the Printz Award, the Best Animated Feature Oscar, the Phoenix Award, and the John Newbery Medal, giving due attention to prizes for fiction as well as for non-fiction, poetry, and film. This volume will interest scholars in literary and cultural studies, social history, book history, sociology, education, library and information science, and anyone concerned with children''s literature.', 'Book', '2016-11-10', 25, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PCMlDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

What do the best fashion companies do that set them apart? Why some companies make it to the top only to go bankrupt a few years later? Is fashion dying? Some seem to think so. Or is it merely a matter of mismanagement? Ralph Lauren closed his flagship Polo store. But Amancio Ortega’s fashion empire is still strong, making him one of the richest men in the entire world across all industries. In this book, we will examine what makes a great fashion company and brand. We look at five key dynamics from various perspectives: • Leadership • Problem solving • Vision • How we see our people • Building creativity and innovation There is no magic bullet that solves everything. There is no overnight success. But there are tested techniques that, when used consistently, build the momentum of an organization until it is unstoppable.

VALUES (498, 'Cultural Capitalism', 'Cultural Capitalism explores Russian literature''s eager embrace of capitalism in the post-Soviet era. When the Soviet Union fell, books were suddenly bought and sold as commodities. Russia''s first bestseller lists brought attention and prestige. Even literary prizes turned to the market for legitimacy. The rise of capitalism entirely transformed both the economics and the aesthetics of Russian literature. By reconstructing the market''s influence on everything from late-Soviet paper shortages to the prose of neoimperialism, Cultural Capitalism reveals Russian literature''s exuberant hopes for and deep disappointments in capitalism. Only a free market, it was hoped, could cure endemic book deficits and liberate literature from ideological constraints. But as the market came to dominate literature, it imposed an ideology of its own, one that directed literary development for decades. Through archival research, original interviews, and provocative readings of literary texts, Bradley A. Gorski immerses the reader in both the economic and aesthetic worlds of post-Soviet Russian literature to reveal a cultural logic dominated by capitalism. The Russian 1990s and early 2000s saw markets introduced, adopted, and debated at an accelerated pace, all against the backdrop of a socialist past, staging the polemics between capitalism and culture in high drama and sharp relief. But the market forces at the center of the post-Soviet transition are fundamental to cultural trends worldwide. By revealing the complexities of Russia''s story, Cultural Capitalism mounts a critique that cuts across national borders and provides a new way of seeing culture in the post-1989 era worldwide.', 'Book', '2025-03-15', 26, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d_wvEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

Quite often though, a hyped bestseller is met with a skeptic criticism of poor language, a badly constructed plot, a predictable story line, or all three. The bestseller phenomenon is sometimes conceived as a threat against “real” literature.

The garden serves as both a place and a metaphor for Mr. Erwin to share a powerful paradigm and practical strategies to help the twins overcome their fear, stress, and anxiety. The Garden is an enlightening and encouraging spiritual fable that reveals the 5 D’s that can sabotage us and a proven plan to help us overcome and win the battle in our mind.

Everyone will struggle with fear, anxiety, or stress at some point in their lives, and everyone will have to overcome these challenges to create the life they were meant to live.

Analyzing reading as a post-digital practice that is a synthesis of both print and digital modes and on- and offline behaviors, Driscoll presents a methodology for studying readers that connects book history, literary studies, sociology, and actor-network theory.

In researching this book, the authors interviewed the residents of the Japanese village with the highest percentage of 100-year-olds—one of the world’s Blue Zones. Ikigai reveals the secrets to their longevity and happiness: how they eat, how they move, how they work, how they foster collaboration and community, and—their best-kept secret—how they find the ikigai that brings satisfaction to their lives. And it provides practical tools to help you discover your own ikigai. Because who doesn’t want to find happiness in every day? What’s your ikigai?', 'Book', '2017-08-29', 19, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CbouDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api');

The conference was organized by the OECD Case Law Project at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg. The book is divided into three sections. The first examines how NCP cases interpret corporate responsibilities, including financial institutions, on human rights and environmental issues, focusing on climate change and conflict-affected zones. It also highlights how OECD cases address corporate accountability and its impact on the revised OECD Guidelines and the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). The second section critically evaluates the NCP mechanism''s effectiveness, assessing whether it provides substantive remedies and how well NCP mediation resolves disputes. It offers both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the grievance processes in line with UNGP effectiveness criteria. The third section explores the NCP’s role in global corporate responsibility frameworks, particularly its potential influence on shaping mandatory due diligence obligations through frameworks like the CSDDD, reinforcing corporate accountability in international business practices. Additionally, the book offers key recommendations for policymakers, NCP experts, and practitioners on improving the NCP system to ensure more meaningful outcomes for human rights violations.', 'Book', '2025-01-03', 33, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JCA8EQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

William James, once the leading psychologist in America, and one of the founders of the philosophical school of pragmatism, put it best: "A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices." Pragmatism believes that the mind is a tool. Your mind should work for you, not against you. People who don''t master their mind, don''t believe it''s possible. They say: "I can''t help but thinking these things." Well, you can TAKE CONTROL of your mind with enough practice. I''ve done it. And in THINK STRAIGHT, I share exactly how. It''s a quick read and you can use it to immediately to improve your thinking. You have the ability to decide what you think. Or, you can choose NOT to think.

SAMPLE EXCERPT: “What was the inspiration behind the creation of this book?” Although many people have expressed how much Bared to You resembles Fifty Shades of Grey, Day said in interviews that her real inspiration for writing this book is her own novel, Seven Years to Sin. It is a historical novel also dealing with a couple recovering from difficult, abusive pasts. In Seven Years to Sin, the main characters were brought together by their histories. But Day wondered how it would be like if the past of two people very attracted to each other push them apart. What if their trauma inhibits them from connecting with the person they are in love with? Can an abuse survivor be able to have a functional and healthy romantic relationship with another abuse survivor? Day wanted to explore that. This premise, the desire to answer these questions at least in the context of a story, resulted in the plotline that will encompass the three books in the Crossfire series. - - - - - Don''t miss out!

Twenty-six-year-old Jean Louise Finch—“Scout”—returns home to Maycomb, Alabama from New York City to visit her aging father, Atticus. Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise’s homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town, and the people dearest to her.

In the first half of life, ambitious strivers embrace a simple formula for success in work and life: focus single-mindedly, work tirelessly, sacrifice personally, and climb the ladder relentlessly. It works. Until it doesn''t. The second half of life is governed by different rules. In middle age, many strivers begin to find success coming harder and harder, rewards less satisfying, and family relationships withering. In response, they do what strivers always do: they double down on work in an attempt to outrun decline and weakness, and deny the changes that are becoming more and more obvious. The result is often anger, fear, and disappointment at a time in life that they imagined would be full of joy, fulfilment and pride. It doesn''t have to be that way. In From Strength to Strength, happiness expert and bestselling author Arthur C. Brooks reveals a path to beating the ''striver''s curse.'' Drawing on science, classical philosophy, theology and history, he shares strategies for releasing old habits and forming new life practices, showing you how to: - Kick the habits of workaholism, success addiction, and self-objectification - Meditate on death - in order to beat fear and live well - Start a spiritual adventure - Embrace weakness in a way that turns it into strength.

This is the framework for meaningful connection.” Don’t miss the five-part Max docuseries Brené Brown: Atlas of the Heart! In Atlas of the Heart, Brown takes us on a journey through eighty-seven of the emotions and experiences that define what it means to be human. As she maps the necessary skills and an actionable framework for meaningful connection, she gives us the language and tools to access a universe of new choices and second chances—a universe where we can share and steward the stories of our bravest and most heartbreaking moments with one another in a way that builds connection. Over the past two decades, Brown’s extensive research into the experiences that make us who we are has shaped the cultural conversation and helped define what it means to be courageous with our lives. Atlas of the Heart draws on this research, as well as on Brown’s singular skills as a storyteller, to show us how accurately naming an experience doesn’t give the experience more power—it gives us the power of understanding, meaning, and choice. Brown shares, “I want this book to be an atlas for all of us, because I believe that, with an adventurous heart and the right maps, we can travel anywhere and never fear losing ourselves.”', 'Book', '2021-11-30', 40, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zkZPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api');

The theme of the conference was ''Stylistics and Social Cognition'', and as usual at a PALA conference, this theme was interpreted very widely by the participants, as the reader of this book will no doubt conclude. At the heart of this volume, there is something of a reaction against the cognitive developments in stylistics, which might be seen as being in danger of privileging the individual interpretation of literature over something more social. The concern is to consider whether there is a more collective approach that could be taken to the meaning of text, and whether recent insights from cognitive stylistics could work with this idea of collectivity to define something we might call ''commonality'' of meaning in texts. Stylistics and Social Cognition will be of interest to those working in stylistics and other text-analytic fields such as critical discourse analysis and those concerned with notions of interpretation, collective meaning and human communication.', 'Book', '2007-01-01', 18, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qFDzypBPJdMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

VALUES (631, 'My Little Book of Exiles', 'The poems of MY LITTLE BOOK OF EXILES sift through layers of diaspora and return, wrestling with the twin experiences of exile and separation. The diasporas of the collection take place in history, family, and the privacy of a mind as it navigates its daily work. In a set of "Labor Poems," Alter captures moments of working in the snow of Wisconsin, under floodlights on the Kenai bay of Alaska, or in the machine-roar of construction sites in the Bay Area, where he has worked for two decades as an electrician. Another set of poems confront the vision of the Jewish people''s homecoming to their ancestral land. A philosopher of the "religion of labor;" and an assassinated Prime Minister are some of the figures which weave in with intimate histories of heartbreak and hope. Coming from a home where the Hebrew Bible was a book of bedtime stories, Alter''s work is in conversation with texts as varied as the Hebrew Psalms, the poetry of John Keats and Ezra Pound and the songs of Bob Dylan and Bob Marley. The collection concludes with poems exploring the homeland of family made through marriage and fatherhood, the strains and moments of grace that come with them. What can withstand the pressures of distance, the forces from outside and inside that want to pull us apart? The book''s strands weave a tapestry of hope even as the poems seek to discover finally what lasts. "''Could I have come from nowhere,'' asks this poet, who searches his irretrievable past and mysterious present for meaning. Through gorgeous, ambitious, impeccable lyrics, provisionally and with a deep reverence for mysteries, he finds it again and again. This smart, funny, sad, kind book is an act of salvage, and solidarity, a pleasure to read, a wonderful achievement and a gift to us all."--Matthew Zapruder "In MY LITTLE BOOK OF EXILES, Dan Alter ''gathers all the departure in his arms,'' and keeps ''peeling layers off the future of his skin.'' This debut collection sings in the form of sonnets, the ''cant i,'' free verse, and prose. Syntax enacts a search and return, performs in arrangement and rearrangement the compositions that scored the poet''s life. The close attention paid to prosody creates a soundtrack that connects personal and communal narratives of the Jewish Diaspora, recounts travels across Europe and Israel, through familial stories that reflect on labor, the music of Bob Marley and Paul Simon, forefathers and fatherhood. MY LITTLE BOOK OF EXILES will make you wonder where you are going, where you''ve been, and from where have you come--and is it possible to go back again."--Arisa White "Dan Alter''s marvelous collection, EXILES, is a book about origins and ends, origins that recede as we approach them, and ends projected into a future out of the deprivations of the present. In this heart wrenching lover''s quarrel with personal and public legacies, Alter''s great achievement is his openness to complication and ambivalence, (see his politically fraught homage to Ezra Pound), his willingness to admit emotional attachment to what he often intellectually distrusts, and the way the agitated music of his lines enact a sense of the present moment as an unsettled and unsettling effect of an even more unsettled past."--Alan R Shapiro Poetry.

Twenty-nine years later, it''s probably the worst possible time in the nation''s history of reproductive legislation for Millie--well, for someone like Millie--to decide rather suddenly that she wants to be pregnant.

Enrique Prado found himself in his first firefight at age seven. The son of a middle-class Cuban family caught in the midst of the Castro Revolution, his family fled their war-torn home for the hope of a better life in America. Fifty years later, the Cuban refugee retired from the Central Intelligence Agency as the CIA equivalent of a two-star general. Black Ops is the story of Ric’s legendary career that spanned two eras, the Cold War and the Age of Terrorism. Operating in the shadows, Ric and his fellow CIA officers fought a little-seen and virtually unknown war to keep the USA safe from those who would do it harm. After duty stations in Central and South America and the Philippines, Black Ops follows Ric into the highest echelons of the CIA’s headquarters at Langley, Virginia. In late 1995, he became Deputy Chief of Station and co-founding member of the Bin Laden Task Force. Three years later, after serving as head of Korean Operations, Ric took on one of the most dangerous missions of his career: to re-establish a once-abandoned CIA station inside a hostile nation long since considered a front line of the fight against Islamic terrorism. He and his team carried out covert operations and developed assets that proved pivotal in the coming War on Terror. A harrowing memoir of life in the shadowy world of assassins, terrorists, spies and revolutionaries, Black Ops is a testament to the courage, creativity and dedication of the Agency’s Special Activities Group and its elite shadow warriors.', 'Book', '2023-08-29', 38, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gr5_EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api');

Poland and Czechoslovakia had already fallen, and the Dunkirk evacuation was just two weeks away. For the next twelve months, Hitler would wage a relentless bombing campaign, killing 45,000 Britons. It was up to Churchill to hold his country together and persuade President Franklin Roosevelt that Britain was a worthy ally—and willing to fight to the end. In The Splendid and the Vile, Erik Larson shows, in cinematic detail, how Churchill taught the British people “the art of being fearless.” It is a story of political brinkmanship, but it’s also an intimate domestic drama, set against the backdrop of Churchill’s prime-ministerial country home, Chequers; his wartime retreat, Ditchley, where he and his entourage go when the moon is brightest and the bombing threat is highest; and of course 10 Downing Street in London. Drawing on diaries, original archival documents, and once-secret intelligence reports—some released only recently—Larson provides a new lens on London’s darkest year through the day-to-day experience of Churchill and his family: his wife, Clementine; their youngest daughter, Mary, who chafes against her parents’ wartime protectiveness; their son, Randolph, and his beautiful, unhappy wife, Pamela; Pamela’s illicit lover, a dashing American emissary; and the advisers in Churchill’s “Secret Circle,” to whom he turns in the hardest moments.

VALUES (693, 'Whole Numbers and Half Truths', '"How do you see India? Fuelled by a surge of migration to cities, the country''s growth appears to be defined by urbanisation and by its growing, prosperous middle class. It is also defined by progressive and liberal young Indians, who vote beyond the constraints of identity, and paradoxically, by an unchecked population explosion and rising crimes against women. Is it, though? In 2020, the annual population growth was down to under 1 per cent. Only thirty-one of hundred Indians live in a city today and just 5 per cent live outside the city of their birth. As recently as 2016, only 4 per cent of young, married respondents in a survey said their spouse belonged to a different caste group. Over 45 per cent of voters said in a pre-2014 election survey that it was important to them that a candidate of their own caste wins elections in their constituency. A large share of reported sexual assaults across India are actually consensual relationships criminalised by parents. And staggeringly, spending more than Rs 8,500 a month puts you in the top 5 per cent of urban India. Data-journalism pioneer Rukmini S. draws on nearly two decades of on-ground reporting experience to piece together a picture that looks nothing like the one you might expect. There is a mountain of data available on India, but it remains opaque, hard to access and harder yet to read, and it does not inform public conversation. Rukmini marshals this information - some of it never before reported - alongside probing interviews with experts and ordinary citizens, to see what the numbers can tell us about India. As she interrogates how data works, and how the push and pull of social and political forces affect it, she creates a blueprint to understand the changes of the last few years and the ones to come - a toolkit for India."-- dust jacket.', 'Book', '2021-01-01', 53, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0STFzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api');

When the computer was asked to “blindly” select the most likely bestsellers out of 5,000 books published over the past thirty years based only on theme, it discovered two possible candidates: The Accident by Danielle Steel and The Associate by John Grisham. The computer recognized quantifiable patterns in their seemingly opposite, but undeniably successful writing careers with legal thrillers and romance. In Chapter 2, Archer and Jockers analyze this data and divulge the most and least likely to best sell topics and themes in fiction with a human discussion of the “why” behind these results. The Bestseller Code is a big-idea book about the relationship between creativity and technology.
